# Impacts of tree canopy coverage on COVID death rate in California counties

This analysis will use simple OLS linear regression to look at the impact of tree canopy cover on the rate of deaths from COVID-19 per positive case at the CA county level. 

This is an important and interesting environmental justice question to consider because tree canopy cover percentages and COVID-19 disproportionately impacted historically marginalized populations throughout the United States. Additionally, both are linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. There is proven evidence that areas with more urban tree canopy have increased public health indicators. This includes lower rates of disease such as asthma, strokes, and cardiac disease. There is also evidence that individuals with existing respiratory and/or cardiovascular disease are not only more likely to contract COVID-19, but also more likely to be sicker or even die.
